# Numark Mixtrack Pro - Phil's Mod (for Traktor)
This Repo contains a modification for the Mixtrack Pro by Numark. The Controller Layout has been modified as well as the original Mapping file for Traktor. The new Layout is a beginner's Layout.

## Install instructions
1. Print out the labels found in the PDF File and have fun cutting them and placing them correctly.
2. Import the Mapping file "Traktor Mapping File.tsi" into Traktor:
   - Open Settings in Traktor
   - goto "Controller Manager"
   - Click "Add"
   - Select "Import PSI" -> "Import Other..."
   - Select the file V1.0.tsi
   - Make sure your controller is selected
   - Click "Close"
3. Have fun!
